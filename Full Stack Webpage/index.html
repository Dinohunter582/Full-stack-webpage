<div class="intro">
    <p> Text editors are very good for programming and are not like other programming applications they have many things that set them apart from each other as well.
        We will go over some of the more well-known text editors.</p>

<h2>what is a text editor</h2>

<!--this section explains what a text editor is and is where are div class for the main body starts-->
<div class="text">
<p>You may be asking yourself what exactly is a text editor. Well, a text editor is a program that edits plain text they have there own operating systems and software dev packages and 
   can be used to change configuration files, document code, and source code. Keep in mind that plain text is very different from rich text, plain text is text made in a text editor and 
   rich text is made in a word processor such as Microsoft Word.

<!--this section tells you the history of a text editor and how they came to be what they are today-->
<h2>The history of a text editor</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>
    Text editors were very simple they use to use punch cards you would put the punch card into a card reader they had no line breaks and could only fit 80 characters on one sheet.
    But once screens such as monitors became available the text editors made their way to screens and were known as screen editors but they were still very limited in what they 
    could do on until they started experimenting with them more to make them what they are today.
</p>
</div>

<!--this section tells you about the different types of text editors and there varying degrees of power and what they can do-->
<h2>Different types of text editors</h2>

<div class="text">
    <p> Some text editors don't do all that much while others can take down pretty much anything you can throw at it. For example, mac os x has text edit which is a hybrid version of a text 
        editor as it has features of a text editor and it has the features of a word processor as well but they must be turned on separately as it can not do both at the same time while it 
        might not be the best it can still do a lot. Some text editors can edit massive files that simple text editors would struggle with these types of data sets such as log files or an 
        entire database and can do it all in one file. While simple text editors cant edits massive files it can still read them in the computer's memory. some editors you can program even more 
        than they already are to serve a specific purpose.
    </p>
    <!--sub heading for the features for text editors-->
    <h3>The features a text editor normally has</h3>
    <!--start back here for texr corecctions-->
    <!--list for the features of text editors-->
    <ul>
        <li>Find and Replace: text editors provide the ability to for text through a a group of files or just single ones, more advanced editors can use regular expressions to search and edit
            text or code.</li>
        <li>Cut,Copy, and Paste: most text editors have a way to do this allowing you to place the same snippet of code in multiple places on the file or multiple files.</li>
        <li>The abilit to hadle UTF-8 encoding.</li>
        <li>Text formatting: Most text editors have the ability to perform basic visual formatting features such as line wrap, auto indentation, bullet list and many other things.</li>
        <li>Undo and Redo: just like word processors, text editors can also do this how many edits a text editor will remember depends on which text editor you are using</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Text editors have many different features like macro or procedure definition, multi view, multi file editing, etc. depending on which one you use they are all very different from each 
        other. There are also specialised editors for example source code editors are text editors that normally have user programmable syntax highlighting and code navigation functions and 
        more coding tools and keyboard macros that work just like they do in html editors.

<!--Microsoft Visual Studio Code is our first text editor we will be talking about and this section includes all things related to the visual studio.-->
<h2>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</h2>

<!--class for visual studio image-->

<img src="images/visual-studio-icon.svg" alt="this the icon for visual studio">
</div>

<!--body text for microsoft visual studio section-->
<div class="text">
<p>Visual Studio Code is a text editor it has alot of features that set it apart from most of the other text editors in this page. it has a feautre called intellisesnse and it 
can autocomplete what it thinks your trying to code and it woeks in multiple diffrent coding launguages such as html, css and java. and has integrated support for github you can 
make and clone repositorys right from visual studio. you can also get add different plugins and customizations for visual studio straight from the app you can change the look, 
get different languages and add extenstions from different apps they also wont slow down the code editor cause they act independently from it. The final best feature of this 
code editor is the ability to launch code straight from the app with microsoft azure and it supports multiple launges for launching your code as well. this is why Visual Studio
is my personal favorite and is what im using to make this webpage right now.
</p>
<!--Pros and Cons list of Visual Studio-->
<h3>pros</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Very active development with Microsoft continually supporting it with updates and shows no signs of slowing down.</li>
    <li>Highly active community with all the plugins you need.</li>
    <li>Insanly fast copmated to other text editors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>cons</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Vscode uses alot of memory and battery.</li>
    <li>Command pallet might be a litlle hard to understand.</li>
    <li>The side preview plugin dosent always work for html and css.</li>
</ul>
<!--Closing statment for Visual Studio section-->
<p>Visual stdio might have some downsides to it but what it lacks it makes up for in power and adaptability. It is combatable with Windows and MacOS.</p>

<!--Brackets is the 2nd text editor were talking about-->
<h2>Brackets</h2>
<!--Brackets icon image-->
<div class="visual">

</div>
<!--the starting of our description for Brackets.-->
<div class="text">
    <!--Body text for Brackets section-->
<p>This is the 2nd text editor we will be talking about it has some features like Visual Studio but it has its own set of feauters as well.
   Brackets is made by  it is a text editor that is clean and simple to use and supports many different coding languages. It is an open source project made by other web 
   developers it is a community project where anyone can contribute to help make it better. Brackets is a lightweight text editor with lots of power and it has an wide variety
   of visual aids to help you with your programming. it has a inline editor so instead of having to swap files you can stay on the one your working on and open up the code you
   need from another file and view it in a seprate window. one of the best features it has is live preview which lets you see the what the webpage will look like while also editing
   the code at the same time and you can see the chages to the webpage happen while you are changing the code. It also has preprocessor support so you can quick edit and live
   highlight your LESS and SCSS files as well. while brackets isnt as feature heavy as Visual Studio it also has it own plugins you can add to it to improve your coding expirence. 
</P>
<!--Pros and cons list for Brackets-->
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Has a live preview function to see the chages to the website in real time.</li>
    <li>Has preprocessor support.</li>
    <li>has an inline editor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Not as many features as Visual Studio.</li>
    <li>Only supports web launguages by default.</li>
    <li>Still missing some basic text editor commands.</li>
</ul>
<!--Closting statment for Brackets section-->
<p> brackets is a very straight forward text editor that is great for people just starting out but it still has a long way to go before it will become a text editor able to 
    compete with visual studio.

<!--Sublime text is the 3rd and final text editor we will be talking about-->
<h2>Sublime text</h2>
<div class="sublime">
<img src="images/sublime-text-icon.png" width="270px" alt="image of Sublime text icon">
</div>
<!--body text for sublime text-->
<div class="text">
    <p>sublime text is the final editor we will talk about really good text editor but you have to pay for this one but its well worth the price for what you get. there is also a free trial for it where you get
        to expiriment with it but after that ends you have to pay to keep using it. it has a wide variet of features to use such as the ability to open files with a couple of
        keystrokes the ability to find definitions for different functions and syntax. being able to edit 2 files in at the same time or splitting the same file into multiple Windows
        to edit multiple places at the same time. this is just some of the features it has to offer it has a lot of other unique ones that make it incredibly powerful and it constantly gets
        updated with new features and quality of life improvements as well but it does cost $80 to keep using after the trial has ended and you have to renew it every 3 years so 
        if you really want this one you better be willing to pay for it.
    </p>
    <!--pros and cons list for sublime text-->
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Wide variety of features with more always being added.</li>
    <li>Trial version to expirment before buying.</li>
    <li>Amazing find and replace system.</li>
    <li>Excellent multitasking.</li>
    <li>Accurate sytax suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Not a wide variet of plugins.</li>
        <li>No autosave.</li>
        <li>Full version costs $80 and you have to renew it every 3 years.</li>
        <li>The command pallete takes time to get use to.</li>
    </ul>
    <!--closing statment for sublime text-->
    <p>sublime text isnt perfect but with new features always getting added it could be eventually and you pay 80 dollars for the full product then after 3 years they charge you
        and upgrade fee of $11 dollars so if you use it alot and like it then it is well worth the money it costs.
